\description{
This method computes Bayes factors for comparing a model with an order restrictions on its parameters
with the fully unrestricted model. \emph{Note that this method should only be used for confirmatory analyses}.

}
\details{
This method is used to compute Bayes factors for order-restricted models vs un-restricted
models by setting an order restriction on the prior and posterior distributions
(\cite{Morey & Wagenmakers, 2013}).

(Though it is possible to use \code{bayesfactor_restricted} to test interval restrictions,
it is more suitable for testing order restrictions (see examples)).

When \code{posterior} is a model (\code{stanreg}, \code{brmsfit}), posterior and prior samples are
extracted for each parameter, and Savage-Dickey Bayes factors are computed for each parameter.

\strong{NOTE:} For \code{brmsfit} models, the model must have been fitted with \emph{custom (non-default)} priors. See example below.

\subsection{Setting the correct \code{prior}}{
It is important to provide the correct \code{prior} for meaningful results.
\itemize{
  \item When \code{posterior} is a \code{data.frame}, \code{prior} should also be a \code{data.frame}, with matching column order.
  \item When \code{posterior} is a \code{stanreg} or \code{brmsfit} model: \itemize{
    \item \code{prior} can be set to \code{NULL}, in which case prior samples are drawn internally.
    \item \code{prior} can also be a model equvilant to \code{posterior} but with samples from the priors \emph{only}.
  }
  \item When \code{posterior} is an \code{emmGrid} object: \itemize{
    \item \code{prior} should be the \code{stanreg} or \code{brmsfit} model used to create the \code{emmGrid} objects.
    \item \code{prior} can also be an \code{emmGrid} object equvilant to \code{posterior} but created with a model of priors samples \emph{only}.
  }
}}
\subsection{Interpreting Bayes Factors}{
A Bayes factor greater than 1 can be interpereted as evidence against the null,
at which one convention is that a Bayes factor greater than 3 can be considered
as "substantial" evidence against the null (and vice versa, a Bayes factor
smaller than 1/3 indicates substantial evidence in favor of the null-hypothesis)
(\cite{Wetzels et al. 2011}).
