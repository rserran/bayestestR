\title{Inclusion Bayes Factors for testing predictors across Bayesian models}
\usage{
bayesfactor_inclusion(models, match_models = FALSE, prior_odds = NULL,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{An object of class \code{\link{bayesfactor_models}} or \code{BFBayesFactor}.}

\item{match_models}{See details.}

\item{prior_odds}{Optional vector of prior odds for the models. See \code{BayesFactor::priorOdds<-}.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
a data frame containing the prior and posterior probabilities, and BF for each effect.

\description{
Inclusion Bayes Factors for testing predictors across Bayesian models
}
\details{
Inclusion Bayes factors answer the question: Are the observed data more
probable under models with a particular effect, than they are under models without
that particular effect? In other words, on average - are models with effect \eqn{X}
more likely to have produced the observed data than models without effect \eqn{X}?
\cr \cr
For more info, see \href{https://easystats.github.io/bayestestR/articles/bayes_factors.html}{the Bayes factors vignette}.

\subsection{Match Models}{
If \code{match_models=FALSE} (default), Inclusion BFs are computed by comparing all models
with a predictor against all models without that predictor. If \code{TRUE},
comparison is restricted to models that (1) do not include any interactions
with the predictor of interest; (2) for interaction predictors, averaging is done
only across models that containe the main effect from which the interaction
predictor is comprised.
}
}
\note{
Random effects in the \code{lme} style will be displayed as interactions:
i.e., \code{(X|G)} will become \code{1:G} and \code{X:G}.

library(bayestestR)

# Using bayesfactor_models:
# ------------------------------
mo0 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ 1, data = iris)
mo1 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
mo2 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species + Petal.Length, data = iris)
mo3 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species * Petal.Length, data = iris)

BFmodels <- bayesfactor_models(mo1, mo2, mo3, denominator = mo0)
bayesfactor_inclusion(BFmodels)
\dontrun{
# BayesFactor
# -------------------------------
library(BayesFactor)

BF <- generalTestBF(len ~ supp * dose, ToothGrowth, progress = FALSE)

bayesfactor_inclusion(BF)

# compare only matched models:
bayesfactor_inclusion(BF, match_models = TRUE)
