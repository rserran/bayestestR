\title{Inclusion Bayes Factors for effects across Bayesian models}
\usage{
bayesfactor_inclusion(models, match_models = FALSE, prior_odds = NULL,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{An object of class \code{\link{bayesfactor_models}} or \code{BFBayesFactor}.}

\item{match_models}{If \code{FALSE} (default), Inclusion BFs are computed by
comparing all models with an effect against all models without the effect. If \code{TRUE},
Inclusion BFs are computed by comparing all models with an effect against models without
the effect AND without any higher-order interactions with the effect (additionally,
interactions are compared only to models with the all main effects).}

\item{prior_odds}{Optional vector of prior odds for the models. See \code{\link[BayesFactor]{priorOdds}}.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
a data frame containing the prior and posterior probabilities, and BF for each effect.
}
\description{
Inclusion Bayes Factors for effects across Bayesian models
}
\details{
Inclusion Bayes factors answer the question: Are the observed data more
probable under models with a particular effect, than they are under models without
that particular effect? In other words, on average - are models with effect \eqn{X}
more likely to have produced the observed data than models without effect \eqn{X}?

}
\note{
Random effects in the \code{lme} style will be displayed as interactions:
i.e., \code{(X|G)} will become \code{1:G} and \code{X:G}.

\examples{
library(bayestestR)

# Using bayesfactor_models:
# ------------------------------
mo0 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ 1, data = iris)
mo1 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
mo2 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species + Petal.Length, data = iris)
mo3 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species * Petal.Length, data = iris)

BFmodels <- bayesfactor_models(mo1, mo2, mo3, denominator = mo0)
bayesfactor_inclusion(BFmodels)

# BayesFactor
# -------------------------------
library(BayesFactor)

BF <- generalTestBF(len ~ supp * dose, ToothGrowth, progress = FALSE)

bayesfactor_inclusion(BF)

# compare only matched models:
bayesfactor_inclusion(BF, match_models = TRUE)
